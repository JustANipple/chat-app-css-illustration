## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Josh's Custom CSS Reset
- SVG path editor
- Keyframes

### What I learned

1. The first and hardest problem was building backgrounds with linear gradients.
I managed to build a similar block on SVG path editor (https://yqnn.github.io/svg-path-editor/)
Getting used to mask a block with SVG resulted the trickiest and the best solution for my challenge
The trick is to have a block with the gradient background and then applying the mask to it makes everything invisible except the form of the SVG

Here is how i made the left purple-pink background:
```css
.purple-bg {
  -webkit-mask-image: url(images/bg-shape.svg);
  mask-image: url(images/bg-shape.svg);
  -webkit-mask-repeat: no-repeat;
  mask-repeat: no-repeat;
  background: linear-gradient(225deg, rgba(206,68,253,1) 0%, rgba(146,62,252,1) 100%);
  width: 500px;
  aspect-ratio: 4/6.25;
  position: absolute;
  left: -19.75rem;
  top: -17rem;
  z-index: -1;
  transition: left 1s ease-in-out, top 1s ease-in-out;
}
```

2. A minor problem was the overflow of negative positioning of absolute elements, in this case the two backgrounds. To make it possible, i used a position relative on the container (body), and then hidden the overflow-x for mobile view, so i can still scroll vertically and overflow (x and y) for desktop view to make it centered and unscrollable

Mobile view:
```css
html, body {
    height: 100%;
    overflow-x: hidden;
}
```

Desktop view:
```css
  body {
    height: 100vh;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    overflow: hidden;
  }
```


```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
